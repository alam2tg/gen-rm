  ## Description
  The purpose of this project is to create a README.md using the Command Line and NodeJs.

  ## Installation
  To install this project, you will need node.js and an Inquirer.js version 8. First, download Node.Js from 'nodejs.org'. Once that is installed  create a repository to house your application, and navigate to it using a CLI. First, run the command ' npm init -y' to initialize npm in your project. Then, you will want to run the command 'npm install inquirer@^8.2.5 (this is the version I have built this program on, newer versions of 8 may be released)... The important thing to know is that you want an inquirer.js version starting with 8.

  ## Usage
  Javascript, Node.js, and Inquirer.js version 8.
